            We strive to build experiences rather than just
            collections of features. Use of software is driven by
            whether it provides a singular and valuable experience.
            We want to be approachable, to engage you in the design
            process. So that you know and we know that you're
            getting an application that does what you need it to
            do.  We work with you closely to design/detail the
            functionality of your application before we start coding,
            saving us time and you money.  We'll work to understand
            your needs and your problems and design a solution that
            feels natural and useable and human.

        A site for neighborhood based job markets, so that you
        can hire kids and feed them chocolate. Built in RoR for
        the good revolutionary population of Lexington, MA.
        Placeholder text free-association. Social local jobs
        neighborhood based, but agile methodology for the win.

        It turns out that poor people do really need drugs, but
        only if they're the prescription kind. This site helps
        college kids help others find things like drugs, food,
        and shelter to ensure overall well-being. And that's really
        no joke at all.
