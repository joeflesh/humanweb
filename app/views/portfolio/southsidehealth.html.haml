    In emergency rooms around the country, doctors routinely prescribe
    antibiotics to patients who do not have access to adequate food or shelter.
    This site easily allows doctors, social workers and others to “prescribe”
    essential health and social services, such as food pantries, employment
    assistance, and childcare.

  %h2.sans What they needed
  %p
    When
    =render('shared/humanweb')
    was first approached to develop the site, it was already in
    widespread use despite major issues with stability and user interface. This
    pointed towards a deep-seated need for such an application, and only made
    us more excited to take on the project.

      &#8220;I was impressed by their personable handling of large focus groups
      and their ability to draw out subtleties in user motivation. Subsequently they
      translated those subtleties into good design. Though the underlying
      technology is complicated, the user design is simple and inviting.&#8221;


  %h2.sans What we did
  %p
    We spent the first few weeks updating the look of the site and fixing
    bugs and usability issues. Then,
    = render 'shared/humanweb'
    met with heavy users of the site
    to discover what they liked, what they didn't, and what they wished they
    could do.
    Through weekly meetings with users, we invested them in the development
    process and were able to get immediate feedback from the people to whom
    the site mattered most.

      &#8220;They took a previous contractor's design and re-architected it so the
      site would scale, all the while keeping the site operational for the
      500+ users who depend on it.&#8221;

  %h2.sans The results
  %p
    South Side Health is now used by social workers and others to serve
    tens of thousands of clients. By centralizing information about services
    available in an area, hospitals reduce unnecessary emergency
    room visits, and social workers help more people find the essentials that
    they need.
