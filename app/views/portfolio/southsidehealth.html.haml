  %p In emergency rooms around the country, doctors routinely prescribe antibiotics to patients who do not have access to adequate food or shelter. This site easily allows doctors, social workers and others to “prescribe” essential health and social services, such as food pantries, employment assistance, and childcare.

  %p When Humanweb was first approached to develop the site, it was already in widespread use despite major issues with stability and ease-of-use. This pointed towards a deep-seated need for such an application, and only made us more excited to take on the project.

  %p Starting from a visual redesign, Humanweb met with heavy users of the site to discover what they liked, what they didn't, and what they wished they could do. Together we charted out weekly iterations of the site.
