  %h2.sans What they needed
  %p
    
    Project EVIE is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the
    adoption of electric vehicles. Humanweb sponsored them by providing
    a beautifully designed web presence.

  %h2.sans What we did
  %p
    Coordinating with EVIE's marketing team, we designed a site incorporating
    smooth eleements that complemeneted their organization's brand.
  %p
    After the team planned their route, we created an interactive map
    mini-site that showed the plan for the entire trip. The mini-site
    was used in presentations to top auto industry executives.

  %h2.sans The result
  %p
    EVIE generated a lot of buzz and raised awareness of fully electric
    vehicles as practical, environmentally superior alternatives.
