    When brothers Steven and David Wade launched their art supply company,
    they needed a site to communicate their vision of sustainable art to
    the world. As veteran designers, they wanted a web studio that could
    deliver perfection down to the pixel. Additionally, the site needed to
    be easily editable to grow and evolve with their company.

    The end result of the collaboration was a heavily customized WordPress
    installation that perfectly conveys the earthy, art-centered brand of
    Global Green Arts.
